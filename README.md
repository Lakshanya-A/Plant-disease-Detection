# PlantPulse

PlantPulse is a machine learning and deep learning project for plant disease detection and analysis. It leverages computer vision and natural language processing to help identify plant diseases and provide solutions.

## Features
- Image-based plant disease detection using deep learning (PyTorch, OpenCV)
- Data visualization and analysis (matplotlib, pandas, numpy)
- Interactive web interface with Streamlit
- Natural language processing for plant disease solutions (transformers)

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for all dependencies. Main packages:
- opencv-python
- streamlit
- pillow
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- transformers
- torch

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Streamlit app (if available):
   ```sh
   streamlit run app/your_app_file.py
   ```
3. For text generation or NLP features, see `app/textgen.py`.
